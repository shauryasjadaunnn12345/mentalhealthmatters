  <p class=info-text>Panic Disorder is a type of anxiety condition marked by frequent and unexpected panic attacks. These episodes may cause heart palpitations, chest tightness, trembling, and a feeling of losing control. If these symptoms are affecting your life, this self-assessment may help you understand your experience better.</p>
  
  <h2 class=info-subtitle>What is Panic Disorder?</h2>
  <p class=info-text>Panic Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. People with panic disorder often worry about when their next attack will occur and actively try to prevent future attacks by avoiding places, situations, or behaviors they associate with panic attacks.</p>
  
  <p class=info-text>Panic attacks typically peak within 10 minutes and subside within 20-30 minutes, but the fear of having another attack can persist and significantly impact daily life.</p>
  
  <h2 class=info-subtitle>Common Symptoms of Panic Disorder</h2>
  <p class=info-text>During a panic attack, you may experience:</p>

  <h2 class=info-subtitle>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
  <p class=info-text>The exact cause of panic disorder is not fully understood, but several factors may contribute:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Panic disorder often runs in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition.</li>
    <li><strong>Brain Chemistry:</strong> Imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA may play a role.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperament:</strong> People who are more sensitive to stress or prone to negative emotions may be at higher risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Life Experiences:</strong> Traumatic events, major life stress, or childhood adversity can trigger panic disorder.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Mental Health Conditions:</strong> Having other anxiety disorders, depression, or substance use disorders increases risk.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class=info-subtitle>Treatment Options</h2>
  <p class=info-text>Panic disorder is highly treatable. Common approaches include:</p>
  
  <div class="info-grid">
    <div class="info-card-grid">
      <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Helps identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that trigger panic attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP):</strong> Explores emotional conflicts that may contribute to panic symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure Therapy:</strong> Gradually exposes you to feared situations in a safe environment to reduce fear responses.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-card-grid">
      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SSRIs and SNRIs:</strong> First-line medications that help regulate serotonin and norepinephrine.</li>
        <li><strong>Benzodiazepines:</strong> Fast-acting medications for acute panic symptoms (used short-term due to dependency risk).</li>
        <li><strong>Beta-Blockers:</strong> Help control physical symptoms like rapid heart rate and trembling.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
