  <p class="info-text">Panic Disorder is a type of anxiety condition marked by frequent and unexpected panic attacks. These episodes may cause heart palpitations, chest tightness, trembling, and a feeling of losing control. If these symptoms are affecting your life, this self-assessment may help you understand your experience better.</p>
  
  <h2 class="info-subtitle">What is Panic Disorder?</h2>
  <p class="info-text">Panic Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. People with panic disorder often worry about when their next attack will occur and actively try to prevent future attacks by avoiding places, situations, or behaviors they associate with panic attacks.</p>
  
  <p class="info-text">Panic attacks typically peak within 10 minutes and subside within 20-30 minutes, but the fear of having another attack can persist and significantly impact daily life.</p>
  
  <h2 class="info-subtitle">Common Symptoms of Panic Disorder</h2>
