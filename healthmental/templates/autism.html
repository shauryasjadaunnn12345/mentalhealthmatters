  <h2>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h2>
  <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior. The term "spectrum" reflects the wide variation in challenges and strengths possessed by each person with autism.</p>
  
  <p>Common traits associated with autism include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Differences in social communication and interaction</li>
    <li>Restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests</li>
    <li>Atypical responses to sensory experiences</li>
    <li>Strong focus on specific topics of interest</li>
    <li>Preference for routines and predictability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Take This Test?</h2>
  <p>This autism test is designed for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adults</strong> who suspect they may be on the autism spectrum</li>
    <li><strong>Teenagers</strong> (16+) experiencing social or communication differences</li>
    <li><strong>Parents</strong> seeking insights about their children's development</li>
    <li><strong>Professionals</strong> looking for a preliminary screening tool</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Consider taking this test if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Struggle with social interactions or making friends</li>
    <li>Have intense, focused interests in specific topics</li>
    <li>Experience sensory sensitivities (to sounds, lights, textures)</li>
    <li>Prefer routines and feel distressed by unexpected changes</li>
    <li>Have been told by others that you might be autistic</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Understanding Your Results</h2>
  <p>Once you complete the test, you will receive a result based on your answers. The scoring system is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>0-11 points:</strong> Low likelihood of autistic traits</li>
    <li><strong>12-17 points:</strong> Average range (some autistic traits may be present)</li>
    <li><strong>18-32 points:</strong> Higher likelihood of autistic traits</li>
    <li><strong>33+ points:</strong> Very high likelihood of autistic traits</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="feature-box">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This test is a screening tool, not a diagnostic instrument. A formal diagnosis can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional through comprehensive evaluation.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>If the score indicates a likelihood of ASD, you may be advised to seek further professional evaluation. If the score is low, it is unlikely that you have ASD, but this test should not replace a formal diagnosis from a healthcare professional.</p>
  
  <h2>Next Steps After Testing</h2>
  <p>Depending on your results, here are some recommended actions:</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>If Your Score is in the Average Range</h3>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Is this test suitable for children?</strong><br>
  This particular test is designed for individuals 16 years and older. For children under 16, we recommend our specialized Childhood Autism Spectrum Test.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How accurate is this autism test?</strong><br>
  The AQ test has shown good reliability in research studies, with approximately 80% accuracy in identifying autistic adults. However, no screening tool is 100% accurate, and results should be followed up with professional assessment if needed.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Can I take this test on behalf of someone else?</strong><br>
  The test is designed for self-assessment. If you're concerned about someone else, encourage them to take the test themselves or seek professional advice.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What's the difference between autism and Asperger's?</strong><br>
  Asperger's Syndrome was previously considered a separate diagnosis but is now included under the broader Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis in the DSM-5. People who would have been diagnosed with Asperger's are now diagnosed with ASD.</p>
