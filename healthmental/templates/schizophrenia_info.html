  <h2>What is Schizophrenia?</h2>
  <p>
    Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder that affects a person's ability to distinguish reality from illusion. It may involve auditory or visual hallucinations, paranoid beliefs, and cognitive disruptions. Common types include paranoid, schizoaffective, and borderline schizophrenia.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations)</li>
    <li>False beliefs that persist despite evidence (delusions)</li>
    <li>Confused thinking or incoherent speech</li>
    <li>Social withdrawal and emotional numbness</li>
    <li>Lack of motivation or interest in daily activities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Take This Test?</h2>

  <h2>Why Early Screening Is Vital</h2>
