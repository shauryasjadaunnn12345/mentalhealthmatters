            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Is this test suitable for teenagers?</strong><br>
            Yes, this test is appropriate for teens 13 years and older. For younger children, we recommend consulting a pediatrician.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How accurate is this insomnia test?</strong><br>
            This test is based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which has been validated in clinical settings. While it's a reliable screening tool, it's not a substitute for professional diagnosis.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can insomnia be cured?</strong><br>
            While there's no universal "cure" for insomnia, it's highly treatable. Many people experience significant improvement with proper treatment and lifestyle changes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's the difference between insomnia and sleep deprivation?</strong><br>
            Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Sleep deprivation occurs when you don't get enough sleep due to external factors (work, lifestyle choices, etc.).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Should I take sleep aids without consulting a doctor?</strong><br>
            It's best to consult a healthcare professional before taking any sleep medication, even over-the-counter options, as they can have side effects and may not address the underlying cause of your insomnia.</p>
