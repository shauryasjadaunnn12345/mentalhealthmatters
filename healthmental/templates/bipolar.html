  <h2>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
  <p>Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood episodes can last for days, weeks, or even months and significantly impact daily functioning, relationships, and quality of life.</p>
  
  <p>There are several types of bipolar disorder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bipolar I Disorder:</strong> Defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days or are so severe that immediate hospital care is needed. Depressive episodes typically occur as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Bipolar II Disorder:</strong> Characterized by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes typical of Bipolar I.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyclothymic Disorder:</strong> Periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)</h2>
  <p>The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is a screening tool developed by a team of psychiatrists, researchers and consumer advocates to help identify bipolar disorder symptoms. It has been validated in multiple studies and is widely used by healthcare professionals as a preliminary screening instrument.</p>

  <h2>Why Take a Bipolar Assessment?</h2>
  <p>Many people with Bipolar II Disorder or Cyclothymia go undiagnosed for years. Taking an online bipolar test can be the first step in understanding your mood patterns and getting the right diagnosis and care.</p>
  
  <p>Early detection and treatment of bipolar disorder can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce the frequency and severity of mood episodes</li>
    <li>Improve relationships and social functioning</li>
    <li>Enhance work or school performance</li>
    <li>Decrease the risk of suicide</li>
    <li>Improve overall quality of life</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Is This Test For?</h2>
  <p>This bipolar quiz is suitable for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adults experiencing mood swings or emotional highs and lows</li>
    <li>Teens showing signs of manic depression or unusual behavior shifts</li>
    <li>Anyone looking for a preliminary bipolar self-diagnosis</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Consider taking this test if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Experience extreme mood swings that affect your daily life</li>
    <li>Have periods of unusually high energy followed by periods of depression</li>
    <li>Have been told by others that your behavior is unusual or erratic</li>
    <li>Have a family history of bipolar disorder</li>
    <li>Are experiencing symptoms that interfere with work, school, or relationships</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The test consists of a series of questions about your mood, behavior, and thought patterns. Your answers help evaluate whether your experiences align with symptoms of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder. Please note: this test is not a diagnosis, but a tool to guide you toward further evaluation.</p>
  
  <div class="info-card">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The MDQ has a sensitivity of about 73% and specificity of about 90%. This means it correctly identifies about 73% of people with bipolar disorder and correctly rules out about 90% of people who do not have bipolar disorder.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Understanding Your Results</h2>
  <p>After completing the test, you'll receive a score based on your answers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Positive Screen:</strong> If you score above the threshold, it suggests possible bipolar disorder symptoms. This doesn't mean you have bipolar disorder, but indicates you should consult a healthcare professional for a complete evaluation.</li>
    <li><strong>Negative Screen:</strong> If you score below the threshold, it suggests you're less likely to have bipolar disorder. However, if you're still experiencing symptoms, you should still consider speaking with a healthcare professional.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps After Testing</h2>
  <p>Regardless of your results, if you're concerned about your mood or mental health:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consult a healthcare professional:</strong> A psychiatrist, psychologist, or primary care physician can provide a comprehensive evaluation.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep a mood journal:</strong> Track your daily moods, sleep patterns, and behaviors to share with your healthcare provider.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn about bipolar disorder:</strong> Understanding the condition can help you recognize symptoms and treatment options.</li>
    <li><strong>Seek support:</strong> Consider joining a support group for people with bipolar disorder or their loved ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Treatment Options for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
  <p>Bipolar disorder is a treatable condition. Common treatment approaches include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants may be prescribed to manage symptoms.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family-focused therapy, and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy can help manage symptoms.</li>
    <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Regular sleep patterns, stress management, and avoiding alcohol and drugs can help stabilize mood.</li>
    <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide valuable support and coping strategies.</li>
  </ul>
