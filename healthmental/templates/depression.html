  <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
  <p>Depression is a common but serious mood disorder that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. It's more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch - it's a persistent condition that can significantly impact your quality of life.</p>
  
  <p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood</li>
    <li>Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism</li>
    <li>Irritability, frustration, or restlessness</li>
    <li>Loss of interest in hobbies or activities</li>
    <li>Decreased energy or fatigue</li>
    <li>Moving or talking more slowly</li>
    <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</li>
    <li>Changes in sleep patterns</li>
    <li>Changes in appetite or weight</li>
    <li>Physical aches or pains without a clear cause</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is the PHQ-9 Depression Test?</h2>
  <p>The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) is a scientifically validated depression screening tool used worldwide by healthcare professionals. It helps diagnose the severity of clinical and chronic depression, including symptoms like hopelessness, loss of interest, and emotional fatigue.</p>
  
  <p>Developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams, Kurt Kroenke, and colleagues, the PHQ-9 is based on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. It has been validated in multiple studies and is widely used in clinical settings.</p>
