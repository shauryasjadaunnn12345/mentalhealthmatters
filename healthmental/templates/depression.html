  <p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood</li>

    <li>Physical aches or pains without a clear cause</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is the PHQ-9 Depression Test?</h2>
  <p>The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) is a scientifically validated depression screening tool used worldwide by healthcare professionals. It helps diagnose the severity of clinical and chronic depression, including symptoms like hopelessness, loss of interest, and emotional fatigue.</p>
  
  <p>Developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams, Kurt Kroenke, and colleagues, the PHQ-9 is based on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. It has been validated in multiple studies and is widely used in clinical settings.</p>
