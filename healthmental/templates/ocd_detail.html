    <h2 class="h1class">What is OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)?</h2>
    <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common but often misunderstood mental health condition. It involves persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive actions or rituals (compulsions) that individuals feel driven to perform. These patterns can become disruptive and interfere with daily life, relationships, and work or school performance.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> OCD affects approximately 2-3% of the global population, making it one of the more common mental health conditions worldwide.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>OCD symptoms can manifest in many forms, including cleanliness rituals, fear of harm, checking behaviors, or mental compulsions. Identifying early signs of OCD is the first step to gaining control and finding support.</p>
    
    <p>The cycle of OCD typically follows a pattern:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Obsession:</strong> An unwanted, intrusive thought, image, or urge causes significant anxiety</li>
      <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> The obsession triggers intense distress, worry, or fear</li>
      <li><strong>Compulsion:</strong> Repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce the anxiety</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Relief:</strong> The compulsion provides brief relief, reinforcing the cycle</li>
    </ol>
