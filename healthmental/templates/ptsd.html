  <h2>What is PTSD?</h2>
  <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can occur after someone has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as an accident, natural disaster, war, or any other event that causes significant emotional or physical harm. It's a mental health condition that can develop when a person has difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event.</p>
  
  <p>PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background. While it's commonly associated with combat veterans, PTSD can result from various traumatic experiences including physical or sexual assault, childhood abuse, accidents, natural disasters, or the sudden death of a loved one.</p>

  <h2>How is PTSD Diagnosed?</h2>
  <p>To diagnose PTSD, mental health professionals use structured interviews and assessments like the PCL-5 (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5). The assessment helps in identifying the frequency and severity of symptoms over the past month.</p>
  
  <p>According to the DSM-5, for a PTSD diagnosis, a person must have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Been exposed to a traumatic event (both direct and indirect exposure)</li>
    <li>At least one re-experiencing symptom</li>
    <li>At least one avoidance symptom</li>
    <li>At least two negative alterations in mood and cognition</li>
    <li>At least two alterations in arousal and reactivity</li>
    <li>Symptoms lasting for more than one month</li>
    <li>Symptoms causing significant distress or impairment in functioning</li>
    <li>Symptoms not attributable to substance use or another medical condition</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Treatment Options for PTSD</h2>
  <p>Effective treatments for PTSD include:</p>

        <li><strong>Exposure Therapy:</strong> Helps safely face traumatic memories and situations</li>
        <li><strong>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):</strong> Uses eye movements to help process traumatic memories</li>
        <li><strong>Prolonged Exposure Therapy:</strong> Gradually exposes you to trauma-related memories and feelings</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Processing Therapy:</strong> Helps modify unhelpful beliefs related to the trauma</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-card-grid">
      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Antidepressants:</strong> SSRIs and SNRIs can help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety</li>

        <li><strong>Prazosin:</strong> Can help reduce nightmares</li>
        <li><strong>Mood stabilizers:</strong> May be used in some cases to help regulate mood</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Is this test suitable for everyone?</strong><br>
  This test is designed for adults 18 years and older. For adolescents and children, we recommend consulting a pediatrician or child psychologist who specializes in trauma.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How accurate is this PTSD test?</strong><br>
  This test is based on the PCL-5 (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5), which has been validated in clinical settings. While it's a reliable screening tool, it's not a substitute for professional diagnosis.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What's the difference between PTSD and complex PTSD (C-PTSD)?</strong><br>
  While PTSD typically results from a single traumatic event, complex PTSD usually stems from prolonged or repeated trauma (such as ongoing abuse or neglect). C-PTSD includes additional symptoms like difficulties with emotional regulation, relationships, and self-concept.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Can PTSD be cured?</strong><br>
  While there's no absolute "cure" for PTSD, it's highly treatable. With proper treatment, many people experience significant reduction in symptoms and can lead fulfilling lives.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How soon after a trauma can PTSD develop?</strong><br>
  PTSD symptoms can develop within a month of the traumatic event, but sometimes they may not appear until months or even years later.</p>
